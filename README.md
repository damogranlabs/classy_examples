# classy_examples
Example project, cases and tests for [classy_blocks](https://github.com/damogranlabs/classy_blocks).

> NOTE! This is an archived version that does not work with version 1 and newer. Please refer to readme and examples in the classy_blocks repository.

# Usage
1. Prerequisites
    1. OpenFOAM (just about any version)
    1. python3
    1. `pip install git+https://github.com/damogranlabs/classy_blocks.git`
1. Run `run.py`
1. Open `case/case.foam` with ParaView to inspect the mesh.
